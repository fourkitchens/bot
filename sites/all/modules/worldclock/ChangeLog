* Clean up code to follow coding standard and removed closing php tag
* Fixed Iran time from 3 to 3.5
* Added 'HTML tags are allowed' to help text
* Moved Javascript installation from hook_init to hook_menu to avoid
  error of drupal_get_path() when the cache is enabled. (for Drupal 5.x)
  For Drupal 6.x, we still uses hook_init.
* Changed Australia and US time zone name from PST -> PT ... since S 
  means Standard and should not be used for Daylight saving time.
  During DST, PDT is the correct exresssion instead of PST.
